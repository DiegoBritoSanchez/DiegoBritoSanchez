Hi 👋 My name is Diego Brito Sánchez
====================================

Web developer and programmer
----------------------------

I've been programming for 2 years. I started with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT, but my passion is backend development and that's why I know how to program in PHP and MySql. 
I've learned an interesting framework like Laravel and I'm currently learning C# and a little bit of the .NET framework.

*   🚀  I am currently looking for a job
*   🧠  I'm learning SQL Server, C# and a little bit of .NET
*   🤝  I'm open to collaborating on interesting projects that will help me in my learning in this world of programming.
*   ⚡  I am not very fluent in English due to lack of practice but I am willing to improve.
