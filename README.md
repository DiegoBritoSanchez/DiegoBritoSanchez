Hi 👋 I'm Diego Brito Sánchez
=============================

🌐 Junior Web Developer | Backend Enthusiast | Open to New Opportunities

I'm a passionate junior developer based in Los Llanos de Aridane, Spain. I started coding with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but quickly discovered that my real interest lies in backend development.

💻 I mainly work with **PHP** and **MySQL**, and I've been building projects using **Laravel**.  
Currently, I'm expanding my skills by learning:
- **React** for frontend development
- **Django** (Python) for backend web apps
- And soon, **Java with Spring Boot**, to gain a solid foundation in enterprise-grade backend development.

🚀 I’m actively looking for a junior developer position to grow professionally and contribute to real-world projects.

🧠 I'm open to collaborating on projects that help me improve my skills, especially in backend development, full-stack frameworks.

📘 I'm also working on improving my English communication skills to connect better in international environments.

Let’s build something great together! 🔧
